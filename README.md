# udacity-DAND-P2
This is the second project that I completed for the Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) at Udacity in FEB 2016. 
I explored potential predictors of survival in the Titanic dataset 
(provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)) 
including gender, age, socio-economic status, and family members aboard. 
You can preview the result through this
